#### **Project Title**  
Financial Analysis Dashboard  

#### **Description**  
This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to building a financial analysis dashboard using Excel, Python, and Power BI. It takes raw sales and revenue data and turns it into an insightful, interactive tool.  

#### **Dataset**  
The dataset includes the following fields:  
- **Demographics:** Region, Country, Sales Representative Name, Gender, Age.  
- **Product Information:** Product Categories (Smartphones, Laptops, etc.), Rank Levels.  
- **Time Periods:** Year, Quarter, Month.  
- **Revenue:** Revenue figures in USD.  

#### **Key Steps**  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned raw data using Excel to handle missing values and ensure consistency.  
2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Used Python (Pandas and NumPy) for calculations like total revenue, revenue growth, and product-specific trends.  
3. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Imported the processed data into Power BI and designed interactive visuals.  
   - Used DAX for custom calculations (e.g., cumulative revenue, top products).  

#### **Features of the Dashboard**  
- Visual representation of revenue trends by region and product.  
- Top-performing sales reps and products highlighted.  
- Drill-down functionality for analyzing specific time periods or categories.  

#### **How to Use**  
1. Open the Power BI file or Excel-based prototype.  
2. Use the filters (e.g., region, product, time period) to explore specific insights.  
3. Analyze performance metrics displayed on the visuals to identify trends and make decisions.  

#### **Outcome**  
The dashboard provides business leaders with an easy-to-use tool for financial performance tracking, improving decision-making efficiency.
